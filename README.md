# budgetme

Bugetme is planned to be a simple budget program to better control finances while learning to make a full app in Python.

I plan to make a nice GUI using tkinter however I may port the program to either django or flask to learn a bit more on web development.

Currently planned functionality is as follows but I will likely alter it as I go.

*Maintain monthly budget
*Utilize SQLite db for transactions
*long term analysis of transactions
*Long term financial planning
*Setting goals over time
*Analysis of retirement
*Multiple accounts
